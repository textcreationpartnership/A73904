            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>And first for instruction, whether may we go, but to the fountaine of wisdome; I say not for those high mysteries of his spirituall worship only, cōcerning which we may read euen in the booke of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he who hath made all things of nothing, is to bee worshipped for his power; hath made all that he hath made <hi>good,</hi> &amp; for our good, is to be worshipped with loue; hath made and disposed all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:150375:6"/>things in such wisedome, as that no one thing can be better or so well deuised, is to be worshipped after his own maner: but euen for those other parts of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, our liuing <hi>soberly</hi> and <hi>iustly</hi> in this present world, for that <hi>word</hi> whereby he hath reuealed vnto the world his <hi>will:</hi> and which is &amp; ought to be no lesse the <hi>law of lawes,</hi> and the <hi>rule of rules,</hi> than he himselfe the <hi>Lord of lords,</hi> and the <hi>King of kings:</hi> though it principally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the high and supernaturall myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of that sauing health, which the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the naturall man cannot conceiue or attaine vnto: yet is it <hi>giuen,</hi> as the Apostle speaketh, <hi>by inspiration of God,</hi> not onely <hi>to teach</hi> truth, and <hi>to improoue</hi> falshood, for matters, of faith; but also <hi>to correct</hi> wickednesse, and <hi>to instruct</hi> in righteousnesse for matters of life, <hi>that the man of God may be absolute, being made perfect vnto all good works.</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. and 17. Indeed the rule, as of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall agents, so of reasonable creatures,
<pb facs="tcp:150375:7"/>is in this all one, that they are to take lawes for their actions and doing, from that power in whom they <hi>liue and moue, and haue their being,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 17.28.</note> that since <hi>all things were created by him and for him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in him.

And therefore as we see in naturall agents (whether they be to beare rule, as the Sun and Moone which are placed in the firmament, or to be ruled, as the elements and parts of this lower world) that they worke as if they knew what they worked, and in their seuerall courses performe his will, as if they were acquainted with his will; and further, that in a relation which they haue one to another, as sociable parts of the whole bodie of the world, they carrie themselues, as if they were bound to serue one anothers good, and all to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:150375:7"/>preferre the good of the whole, before whatsoeuer their owne particular; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as things heauie by nature, will sometime of their owne accord mount vpward, and forsake the centre of the earth, which to them is most naturall; as if they heard the voice of God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunding them to let goe their priuat good, to reliue the distresse of nature in common: so doth it much more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne those his creatures, whom he hath made in a manner partakers of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature, and endued with reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble soules, to vnderstand both his will and the reason of his will, that they <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to his voice,</hi>

The wisdome of man hath spent both her time and her selfe in the search of this point, to

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:150375:13"/>boni:</hi> they doubt whether there be any nature of good, because they know not what it is.

Es.</hi> 3.20. which, as it taketh all power from princes, to make their <hi>will, reason,</hi> and their <hi>pleasure, right;</hi> so doth it leaue no libertie either to prince or people, to excuse euill by the multitude, as if it were well done which
<pb facs="tcp:150375:14"/>is done commonly; or to defend euill by the example of euill doers, as if it were lawfully done, which is done by authoritie; or to iustifie euill by the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of euill doing, as if there were no exception against it, when there is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of time for it. For euen they, who had not the true knowledge of the liuing God, had yet this persuasion of the nature of good, <hi>Si Deos homines que celare possent, nihil iniuste, nihil auare, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil libidiniose, esse faciendū,</hi> that though there were no feare either of God or of man, yet there was nothing vniustly, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing couetously, nothing wickedly to be committed. Which is the true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14, where he speaketh of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that <hi>they are a law vnto themselues;</hi> not that things are good or euill as they make them, but that they haue the <hi>effect of his law written in their hearts</hi> and consciences; when they cannot but yeeld their assent, without question, to those principles of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:150375:14"/>good, that <hi>good is to be loued,</hi> that the <hi>greater good is to be preferred before the lesser,</hi> that we are to <hi>doe as we would be done vnto,</hi> and such like. Which in as much as they haue not bene reuealed to them by such extraordinarie meanes as to the people of God, therefore haue they bene reputed the makers of those lawes, which are indeed God his lawes, and they but onely the finders out of them, or rather of the will of God in them. And surely if there were no more but these principles of good, deliuered in a generalitie vnto man in that other booke of God, the <hi>law of nature;</hi> it were inough to prooue, that there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant nature of good, not in opinion, but in truth, not as it is made by law, but as it is indeed. And therefore <hi>Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> in his third booke &amp; fourteenth chapter, <hi>De doctrina Christiana,</hi> taxing some whom hee calleth <hi>Dormitantes,</hi> halfe waking men, as neither altogether asleepe in ignorance, nor throughly
<pb facs="tcp:150375:15"/>awaked to see so much of the truth as they might, for thinking nothing iust in it selfe but according to the custome of euery nation, vseth but that one rule, <hi>Doe as thou wouldest be done vnto,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute them: which, saith he, <hi>Cum refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur ad dilectionem Dei omnia flagitia mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuntur; cum ad dilectionem proximi, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia facinora:</hi> referre it to the loue of God, and it extinguisheth all crimes, to the loue of thy neighbour, and it banisheth all wrongs out of the world. But that which the booke of nature teacheth confusedly, and but in a generalitie, and therefore is compared by an auntient loriter, to the <hi>dawning of the day,</hi> neither so darke as night, nor so cleere as day; neither hiding all, nor reuealing all the nature of good vnto vs, inough as the Apostle gathereth,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.15.</note>
                  <hi>to accuse the</hi> consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but not inough to reforme the will: is made as cleere as the noone day, by that Sonne <hi>of righteousnesse,</hi> whose <hi>law is perfect concerning the soule:</hi>

In which iudgements of God, as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but see, with how perfect hatred hee hateth sinne, when it maketh things o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise good, euill in his sight; and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple dearely beloued, not so deare vnto him, but that the frailties of the godly doe grieue, as the presumptions of the wicked despite the spirit of grace: so may we thereby gather, that he who hateth nothing but sinne, doth punish nothing but sinne in vs. For howsoeuer, in that litle conscience which we make of sinne, we make the lesse acount of his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and because we doe not thinke our selues to sinne, when we sinne, we do not imagine out selues to be punished when we are punished: yet if we deale
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:150375:45"/>truly with our own hearts, we shall find, that no euill doth at any time befall vs, but it is the punishment of some sinne; and that, though our sinnes be sometime forborne, vntill they be ripe for the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uest; yet doth the forbearing ad a weight to the punishment, and the iudgements of God grow then most heauy vpon vs, when we make light our of sinnes: nay those iudgements whereof we haue an hard conceit, when either the wicked are the instruments of God his wrath, or the reason of his iustice is hidden in them; if we turne backe the eyes of our remembrance, will bring vs to some such sinne, as may be inough to prooue them iust. And therefore, as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> aduised certaine chast virgins, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded God to bee vniust,<note place="margin">Lib. I. decim.

<pb facs="tcp:150375:46"/>of the wicked most wrongfully, we are not so much to consider how wicked they are by whom we suffer, as how, iust he is, who vseth their wickednesse to the punishment of our sins.

               <hi>that it was he,</hi> when indeed it <hi>was himselfe, and his fathers house, that troubled Israel:</hi> so the magistrates doe cast this iudgement of God vpon the faults of the ministers, and the ministers vpon the faults of the magistrates; the lawyer vpon the marchant, and the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant vpon the lawyer; the Court vpon the countrey, and the countrey vpon the Court; the rich vpon the sinnes of the poore, and the poore vpon the sinnes of the rich; euery one vpon euery other, no man vpon himselfe. And this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison is that deceitfull ballance which maketh vs to commit many errors, as
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:150375:58"/>well in the conscience of our sinnes, as in the sence of God his iudgements, That if our pastors be worse than we, we are no sinners; and if we be plagued for the sinnes of our rulers, it is no sinne of ours that hath deserued to bee plagued with such rulers. If wee at any time bee op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with the crueltie, or disgraced by the enuie, or wronged by the iniustice and tyrannie of the wicked; wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine (and in some respect not without cause) of the wicked, by whom wee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue our iniurie: wee neuer enter into our own hearts, to find that sinne which our good God, who can iustly vse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust meanes, doth punish in vs. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if we did in singlenesse of heart exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine euery one our owne waies, and sincerely acknowledge the <hi>grosse corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our magistracie,</hi> in seeking (for the most) their owne, before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good; <hi>the shamefull abuses of our ministerie,</hi> in being (many of vs) no where ministers but in the pulpit, if in

For we are al members of one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and as the publicke sinnes of priuat persons prouoke the wrath of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whole kingdomes: so when the iudgements of God light heauie vpon any part of the whole, euery part of the whole is to be mooued with it, as it were with the fire of a whole citie, though begun but in one house.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:150375:60"/>without losse, and our peace changed into peace again. Secondly, in respect of his <hi>iust mercy,</hi> that when it stood not with his <hi>Iustice</hi> to let so many and so great transgressions to passe vnpunished; when our peace had deserued either to be oppressed with the tyrannie of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne sword, or torne in peeces with the furie of a ciuile dissention, and our plentie, or fulnesse of bread, to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with a scarcitie, or cleannesse of teeth; he should giue vs as it were the choice of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and visit vs with no other rod then that of the pestilence, whereby we fall but <hi>into his owne hand, whose mercies are great,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.14. Thirdly, in respect of his (if I may so call it) <hi>vnmercifull iustice;</hi> that when the plague was due to our sinnes, that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy instrument of his glory and our good, <hi>our Soueraigne,</hi> should haue his part in this iudgement▪ and not onely be visited at the gates of his court, but also driuen from his owne houses, and

I haue sinned, yea I haue done wickedly, but these sheepe what haue they done?</hi> So our case being cleane contrary, our cry should be accordingly; we O Lord, we are they that haue offended, but thine annoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>our Soueraigne,</hi> what hee hath done, that he should bee welcommed to his birthright with a plague for our sinnes?
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:150375:61"/>The rather because he who as yet doth but smite, and make sicke in smiting will proportiō his iudgements to our sinnes, and as it followeth in the last place, <hi>make vs desolate for our sinnes,</hi> if we meet him not with repentāce in the way. For he who <hi>ordereth all things, in measure, number and weight, Wisd.</hi> 11.17; as hee hath a rule for persons that <hi>potentes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenter,</hi> the mightie shall be mightily tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, <hi>Wisd.</hi> 6.6: so hath he the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of <hi>tantum</hi> and <hi>quantum</hi> in his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: <hi>so much as the sinfull citie hath li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in pleasures, so much shall be giuen to her torments, Reue.</hi> 18.7; the proud nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>with the sonne of the morning will ascend into heauen, shall bee brought down to hell, Es.</hi> 14.13; the obstinat people <hi>that will not heare when the Lord crieth, shall cry vnto the Lord, and not be heard, Zach.</hi> 7 13; such a proportion hath he in his iudgements, that if the good men of a land be but <hi>as a basket of summer fruit,</hi> whose goodnes cannot continue,

               <hi>fortified with a tower</hi> of his strength: yet for the excesse of sinne, did he lay them wast, and leaue them <hi>as a cottage in a vineyard, or a lodge in a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of cowcumbers Esa.</hi> 1.8. But this iudgement to this land, doth he as yet rather threaten, then hasten; as willing
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:150375:62"/>to trie vs by all meanes, before he come vnto extreamities: yea it is more then manifest, that he is more ready to turne from his wrath, then wee from our sinnes, in <hi>that he plucketh vs as a fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand out of the flame of</hi> his heauie dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.11: And at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent seemeth to say vnto the <hi>Angell</hi> of his wrath, as he did in the time of king <hi>Dauid, It is sufficient, hold now thy hand</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.16.

For therefore is the <hi>Church</hi> in all dutie more than bound to <hi>Princes,</hi> because shee hath her peace in their fauour; and so much the better do things goe with princes, by how much they haue the greater care of religion; insomuch, as, <hi>religion</hi> and <hi>gouernment</hi> are rightly said, <hi>Mutuis stare non officijs solum sed beneficijs,</hi> to haue their strēgth not onely in the <hi>duties</hi> but in the <hi>benefits</hi> of the one vnto the other. Wherein it is hard to say, Whether the goodnesse of God were greater toward the church or toward princes, when he called the mightie ones of the world, who were puffed vp with the opinion of their owne power, and seeing nothing aboue them, contemned all that was below them, to submit themselues to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as to the planting of doctrine, hee used not the wisedome of the world, but
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:150375:67"/>

               <note place="margin">Pro. 8.16.</note> so it is he to whom they raign; &amp; as frō him they fetch the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, so to him they must refer the end of their gouernmēt: for as in the body natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall the soule is the life of the body, but God the life of the soule; so in the body politick, the life of gouernmēt is law, but the life of law, is religiō: which they that saw nothing but by the light of nature, did in some measure attaine vnto, whē out of their reason they gathered, that the soule
<pb facs="tcp:150375:73"/>of man was an heauenly substance, and therby implied that the perfection ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was the knowledge of some more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine nature: which some of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued to be the creator, others imagined to be but the gouernour of heauen and earth. And therefore when by the same light they farther saw, that man was by nature a sociable creature, and that in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile societie, some were borne to rule, &amp; some to obey, and that of many kinds of gouernment, there was none so naturall as that of one; though they yeelded au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie vnto them that did excell, and made good and wholesome lawes for them that were to obey: yet the strength of all their states was in their religion, by the which they were persuaded, that their <hi>Princes were the children of their gods,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hom. &amp; He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siod.</note> and their lawes drawne from the Oracles of some diuine power. They found by experience, how hard it was for men to be brought to obey man, vnlesse they had the authoritie of more than
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:150375:73"/>men; and how little reuerence would be giuen to lawes, if they were not deriued from such a power, as was rather to bee heard with the eare of obedience, than looked into with the eye of curiositie.

<pb facs="tcp:150375:75"/>cannot so well rellish the same policies out of this booke, as out of prophane authors; they should find that the religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, though it chiefely intend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother life, yet it hath the best rules for this; and making men no lesse wise, hath only this difference, that it maketh them more vertuous, and that not onely in those duties which become priuat per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but in those also which concerne the state of a kingdome.

            <p>For whereas lawes doe but looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the facts, &amp; prune the outrage of euill actions; the rules of religion examine

Whereas religion (I euer ad if it be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in them) will reforme the great ones themselues, and make their eyes single without respect of persons, and their eares indifferent to the equitie of suites, and their hands cleane from the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of rewards, and their hearts vpright to doe nothing without the testimonie of a good conscience.

<pb facs="tcp:150375:77"/>hearts to be lamented, that in so great light there should bee so little fruit, and in so great shew so little truth of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; that in all degrees irreligious hearts should maske vnder religious fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and a true Christian no more bee knowne by what hee professeth, then a true friend by what hee seemeth; that whereas the truth of religion is the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruer of gouernment, &amp; the mother of obedience; the name of religion is made the firebrand of kingdomes, and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of disobedience; and that not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to maintaine the tyranny of that vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping power, who taketh vpon him to depose kings; but also to bring in that anarchie of factious subiects, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to giue lawes to their lawfull prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath it pleased God, in great wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to load their crownes with cares, that they might cast their care vpon him. <hi rend="margQuotes">And in that image in the second of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> 32, 33, hath he giuen great estates to vnderstand, that though they haue <hi>heads of gold, armes and brest of siluer, belly and thighes of brasse, and legs of iron,</hi>yet they haue but <hi>feet of earth:</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:150375:96"/>admit that we were not so happie in the written word of God, which is the light of all truth, and the rule of all good, and the life of all lawes, as that in such euidence, no man may plead the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of good and euill; yet were there inough in the naturall law of man his reason to condemne vs for either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerting or confounding the nature of good and euill. <hi>The Gentiles,</hi> saith the Apostle, Rom. 2.14, <hi>doe by nature the things conteined in the law, and hauing not the law are a law vnto themselues, in as much, as the effect of the law is written in their hearts.</hi> And though that high and sauing misterie of <hi>God in Christ,</hi> bee aboue the reach of mans either reason or conceit; yet doth reason bring vs by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, to a power aboue all other pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and therefore aboue all other things to be worshipped.

To note but one for all, out of that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of reason <hi>that the greater good is to bee chosen before the lesse,</hi> the Apostle 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, concludeth, <hi>that things eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall are to be preferred before things tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall;</hi> and our Sauiour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.26, that <hi>it is no gaine for a man to win the whole world, with the losse of his owne soule.</hi> Out of which and many other of
<pb facs="tcp:150375:97"/>that kind, may reason it selfe, if it will be but it selfe, gather that there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant nature of good and euill, and not onely a bare opinion or consent, as this or that nation hath at any time made this or that good or euill. In deed it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied but that the generall rules of good and euill are in reason so plaine, as that they carrie our consents without any farther proofe of them: but all the difficultie is in our seuerall cases and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular actions; whereby it is come to passe, that as one said of the controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of religion, That though the grounds were true, yet the questions had made it <hi>rem ingeniosam esse Christianum,</hi> a matter of great wit to be a Christian: so though the rules of good and euill bee plainely true, yet good and euill actions doe stand vpon so many circumstances, as that it is a matter of great wisedome to be a good Christian. Howbeit euen in this behalfe haue we a good help, and that within vs, to leuell euery action of

               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:150375:98"/>to be ashamed of nothing, <hi>Es.</hi> 48.4, but robbeth the mind also (I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a more secret or iust iudgement of God) of the gift of vnderstanding; and they thinke not amisse that thinke this <hi>custome</hi> of euill to be <hi>that hot yron which seareth the conscience,</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2, that it can haue no sence of good and euill. And in this case when <hi>custome</hi> hath blinded the eye of reason, and seared the conscience of good and euill; what can be truly good? what can bee truly euill vnto vs? nay, how can it be, but that there grow a manifest confusion both of good and euill; when the <hi>generalitie</hi> of sinne may excuse it, and the <hi>custome</hi> of sinne defend it, and the <hi>authoritie</hi> of sinners giue authoritie vnto it? And yet who is he that doth not thinke euerie thing <hi>safely done that is done commonly,</hi> and <hi>lawfully done that is done by prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>iustly done, that is done by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> For wherein doe the wicked ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine themselues to haue so safe a prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<pb facs="tcp:150375:99"/>as when they doe as the most do? when the generalitie of swearing hath made it nothing to take the name of the Lord in vaine; and the common fashion of courting, nothing to lay siege to any womans chastitie; when company will excuse all the faults of good fellowship; and the multitude of fantasticall, make good the pride of all fashions: and though <hi>we may not follow a multitude to doe euill, Exod,</hi> 23.2, yet we flatter our selues, that the sinne is the lesse, the more cōmit it. But that which generalitie will but excuse, that will custome defend, and thinke that time hath gotten a right to do it. The world is hardly weaned from old euils, and many in most things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a safe plea, They were not the first that did so. This custome, hath made nothing sacriledge in the spoile of one Church, nothing symonie in the sale of Church liuings; this custome, maketh euery thing lawfull that hath but one president; and the most to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:150375:99"/>that whatsoeuer hath been done, may be done, though it be worse done than euer it hath beene. But then doth sinne most lift vp her head, when shee hath authority to giue her countenance; when she is armed with power to break lawes, and so guarded with <hi>Scandalum magnatum,</hi> that fame if selfe shall not dare to whisper a truth against it; when mightie men will presume to doe those things by their places which for their places they should lesse doe then others; and in defence of their actions haue as good counsaile about them as that of the Nobles of Persia to <hi>Cambises;</hi> that <hi>though there were no direct law whereby he might marrie his owne sister,</hi>

               <hi>yet there was law inough whereby hee might doe what he listed.</hi> Which is the truest signe of a declining state, when such as excell in place doe not excell in vertue, but by the nobilitie of their birth, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of their places make good their vices, whē their liues are drawne into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples,
<pb facs="tcp:150375:100"/>and their examples into rules, and whole states corrupted by them; when vertuè hath no grace to spring vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, and <hi>he that refraineth from euill maketh himselfe but a pray,</hi> Es. 59.15: When flatterie will iustifie them in the worst of their wayes, and verifie that of them which Seneca somtime partially spake of his friend <hi>Cato, obiecit aeliquis ebrietatem Catoni? citius efficiet crimen honestum quam turpem Catonem:</hi> obiect whosoeuer will whatsoeuer hee will against authoritie, he shall sooner get authority to the thing obiected then disgrace authoritie. How much the greater burthen, is layd vpon the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of all in authoritie; that since their places doe in a maner make good what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they are, they bee no other then becomes their places; that since their liues are drawne into examples, &amp; their examples into rules, they be examples of nothing but good: and aboue all, that they neither flatter nor suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:150375:100"/>to be flattered in their euill waies, least they bee caried away with that ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie of opinion to thinke their will reason, and their pleasure right. For if once ouerweening opinion possesse ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther publique or priuat persons, it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth no eare for any persuasion, it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not onely rules to her purpose, but reason to her seruice, and euer endeth in that conclusion, <hi>non persuadebis etiamsi persuaseris,</hi> she will not bee persuaded though shee bee persuaded. Which is that fatall miserie of these latter times, in the which the plentie not of sound but superficiall knowledge, hath made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing good but in shew, nothing true but in opinion; when for iustice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene kingdome and kingdome, <hi>the better sword hath eaten vp the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> and for iustice betweene people of the same gouernment, <hi>lawes are lost in the cases of the law:</hi> and for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruer of all both truth and iustice, <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it selfe is in a manner lost in the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions
<pb facs="tcp:150375:101"/>of religion.</hi> For who can denie that to bee true of our times which <hi>Hillarie</hi> wrate of his, <hi>to nunc fides existere quot voluntates, &amp; tot doctrinas quot mores; dum aut ita scribuntur vt volumus, aut ita vt volumus intelliguntur,</hi> that there are so many religions as opinions, so many doctrines as manners of men, when either we write them as we list, or as we list we vnderstand them: not that we haue not one and the same, a certaine rule, the word written, which rightly vnderstood will euer hold vs in the vnity of faith; but because in the wantonnesse of this disputing age, we rather looke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it with the eye of curiositie, then har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto it with the eare of obedience, and rather bring sharpe wits, then good minds to the vnderstanding of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and to haue religion rather flying amongst vs in the aire of opinions, then setled in our hearts, with any truth of persuasion. And hereof it is that the Church of Christ which should bee <hi>the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:150375:101"/>pillar of truth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.15.</note> and the schoole of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, is made a sea of contention, while men that should fetch their opinions from the word, doe come with preiudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate opinions vnto the word, and flatter themselues it euer soundeth as they thinke; <note place="margin">Rom. 12.3.</note> who if they would once bee <hi>wise vnto sobrietie,</hi> and acknowledging the true grounds, agree in the right issues; the conclusions of peace would necessarily follow. But flesh and blood which is blind in the best things, can yet foresee thus much, that the libertie of loosenesse must bee taken away if the questions of religion were once ended: and that there could bee no pretence to make their euill, good, if there were no exception against the rule of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: and therefore as ages haue encreased in euill, so haue they multiplied their euill opinions of the <hi>truth:</hi> and if there were nothing else, it were inough to prooue this to be the worst of ages, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it hath brought forth the worst of
<pb facs="tcp:150375:102"/>opinions, if it may be called an opinion, and not rather a desperat madnesse that presumeth to call the grounds of all truth in question. For howsoeuer many heresies haue bene the patrones of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sinnes, as the Anabaptists of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to lawfull magistrates; Ochinus and his followers of the pluralitie, the Nicholaitans of the communitie of wiues; yet was there neuer any that made all euill, good, but that of <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme:</hi> in the which, as in the bottomlesse pit of all euill, all both errors &amp; heresies doe loose themselues. And to that depth of impiety, what can be euill when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is good? what can be a sinne when nothing is a law? what can hee beleeue to whom the storie of the creation is a fable, and the misterie of the incarnation a matter incredible, and all religion a meere pollicie? what can he either hope or feare, who acknowledgeth no resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, no iudgement, no heauen, no hell, no God at all? An illusion stronger
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:150375:102"/>then any reason would imagine possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in any reasonable creature, if the liues of many did not speake their hearts, and the <hi>heart of impietie</hi> open in some <hi>the mouth of impudencie.</hi> Yet will I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beleeue but that at sometime or other their owne hearts doe tell them otherwise, how that soule of theirs which cannot like the life of brute beasts be satisfied with any earthly thing, must needs haue an end beyond whatsoeuer this life can yeeld vnto it; and that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer in their desperate humours they open their mouthes against God or against heauen, whensoeuer they bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row shadow of reason from vaine philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie or prophane gentilitie against the creation of the world, against the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation of Christ, they rather vtter <hi>what they wish,</hi> then <hi>what they are indeed persuaded;</hi> as wishing that there were no God, no heauen, no hell, no resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no iudgement: that so they might the more freely sinne, and neuer bee in
<pb facs="tcp:150375:103"/>danger to account for it. Wherefore it is not the too much learning, as some doe fondly imagine, but the too much licentiousnesse of this age, that breedeth either heresie or Atheisme; when wee maintaine our opinions but to iustifie our affections, and could be content (many of vs) not only that there were no God, but also no true rules of good, so that we might make our sinnes good. Which is the simplest sophistrie that euer was deuised, to erre that wee may erre; and to be glad to be deceiued with an <hi>euill opinion of good,</hi> that we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue our selues <hi>with a good opinion of euill.</hi> But whatsoeuer we striue by cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to make them, <hi>good</hi> will bee <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>euill</hi> will be <hi>euill:</hi> and though <hi>mala sunt vicina bonis,</hi> some euils haue affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with some goods, yet haue they a contrarietie in their neerest affinitie: and that righteous iudge of good and euill, who cannot endure <hi>to haue euill done that good way come thereby,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.8.</note> will lesse en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:150375:103"/>the confounding of good and euill, in as much as he hath denounced a woe against it. And this woe as it requireth truth in our iudgement of things, so doth it require truth also in our censure of persons; that neither by malice wee make good men euill, neither yet by flatterie euill men good: especially if we haue the honour to be the eares of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the credit of other men depend vpon the truth of our report. For beside the sinne, it is an iniurie both <hi>to the prince</hi> and <hi>to the state,</hi> that either any worth should bee disgraced by malice, or any vnworthinesse smoothed vp with flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie: <hi>to the prince,</hi> because Maiestie is thereby imprisoned within the blind eyes and the partiall eares of other mens affections, and so made subiect that miserie which <hi>Seneca</hi> obserued, <hi>vt om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia possidentibus desit qui verum dicat,</hi> that they which abound in other things are farthest off from knowing the truth: <hi>to the state,</hi> that the rewards of vertue are
<pb facs="tcp:150375:104"/>not open to desart, but shut vp within the narrow bounds of their fauour, who either cannot iudge, or will respect but (as they call them) their owne creatures. Which is the chiefe root of discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when euery man will thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to haue a part in the disgrace of the most worthie, and suiters themselues will take it for no disgrace to see more worthie preferred before them. Howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it in this case as in the other, the libertie of our times, hath brought all but to <hi>opinion,</hi> and made it nothing <hi>to be,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we <hi>be thought:</hi> in so much as sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vertue, that is, vertue without mony or friends, doth endure a kind of <hi>Ostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisme,</hi> and either must liue to opinion, or bee content to liue in disgrace. Yet when all is done, <hi>truth</hi> must be the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit both of persons and things, and in the end will haue <hi>grace</hi> both with God and man: and though the <hi>Sophistrie</hi> of <hi>opinion</hi> carie all for a time; yet doth it cary but to that woe; the miserie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:150375:104"/>of will at length bring all backe to that it was; restore <hi>good</hi> to the <hi>opinion of good,</hi> and <hi>true vertue</hi> to the <hi>honour of true vertue.</hi> But God is more mercifull then to punish our confusion of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>euill,</hi> with the vtter confusion of our estate, and therefore before he send the <hi>woe</hi> of our destruction, hee denounceth <hi>woe</hi> to our correction; and though hee may hitherto say of vs as he doth of his owne people, Amos 4, <hi>I haue giuen you cleannesse of teeth and scarcenes of bread; yet haue not you returned vnto me: I haue smitten you with blasting and mildew, your gardens and your fruits did the pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer worme deuoure, yet haue you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned vnto me: pestilence haue I sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst you after the manner of Aegypt, yet haue you not returned vnto mee;</hi> I haue brought the enemie to your gates, <hi>yet haue you not returned vnto me;</hi> nay <hi>I haue pluckt you as a firebrand out of the burning, yet haue you not returned vnto me:</hi> yet doth he not giue ouer to waite
<pb facs="tcp:150375:105"/>with a patience beyond all patience, that at the least wee should at the last returne vnto him and make our benefit of the sound of that <hi>woe</hi> which he denounceth against the extremitie of whatsoeuer <hi>woe</hi> doth hang ouer vs; that being gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by his spirit, according to the rules of his word, we may make a true diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>euill,</hi> to the intire fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of the one, and the perfect ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of the other.

<pb facs="tcp:150375:114"/>anothers good,</hi> 1. Cor. 10.24. True it is, that for the loue of Christ, we are willed in the scripture <hi>to sell all that we haue,</hi> yea <hi>to hate our parents</hi> whom yet wee are commanded to honour,<note place="margin">Luke 18.22. Luke 14.26. Mat. 5.29.</note>
               <hi>to plucke out our right eyes, and to cut off our right hands,</hi> and whatsoeuer is neerer or deerer vnto vs; but this is done in a respect, rather to teach vs, how to vse the things of this world, then how to refuse them; that wee should not more loue riches then Christ, or more regard our earthly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents then our father which is in heauen; or more esteeme the life of the bodie then the life to come; both which loue may stand together, if one be referred to the seruice of the other. To which sence the <hi>Apostle</hi> 1.

               <note place="margin">Heb. 13.14.</note> but wee looke for a better
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:150375:114"/>place; and that wee are not lords, but stewards of the things which wee pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse, and therefore to answere, not only for abusing but euen for not vsing them, to the better seruice of God. For he that is glorious in his creatures, will be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified also in the vse of them; and though <hi>he will be worshipped in spirit,</hi> hath yet vouchsafed our <hi>bodies to be the temples of the holy ghost,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iohn. 4.24.</note> and therefore dedicated to his seruice:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.19.</note> so that <hi>to haue our conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in heauen,</hi> is not to possesse nothing, or to go out of the bodie, but euen with our goods, and in our bodies to serue him, vpon whom our affections are set in heauen. For as the bodie of the Sun, though it keepe his course in heauen, doth yet reach vnto the earth with his beames; so though with our bodies we walke vpon earth, our affections must be caried into heauen, and so caried, not that they leaue or carie the bodie with them (as the friers doe foolishly faine of their S. <hi>Francis,</hi> that his zeale in prayer
<pb facs="tcp:150375:115"/>did lift his very bodie from the ground) but that they frame it, as farre as the frailtie thereof will beare, to lead a life answerable to that aboue. Now the propotion that is required in this life, is resembled vnto vs in the frame of our hearts; that as our hearts are broad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue and pointed beneath, so we should enlarge and spread our affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards heauen, and draw them to as nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a point as possibly we may, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning earth and earthly things. For as it is impossible with the same eye, to looke vp to heauen, and yet to behold the earth; so doth it fare with the heart, that it hath no meane, but either it must bee whollie caried into heauen, or whollie caried away with the things of the earth: not that the spiritually minded man may not enioy the things of the earth, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is impossible hee should ioy in them: and therefore in the words next before, are they, who are <hi>earthly minded,</hi> that is, not which enioy, but ioy in earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:150375:115"/>things, said to be <hi>enemies to the crosse of Christ,</hi> and to make their very <hi>bellie their god:</hi> whereas on the other side, they that <hi>seeke the things that are aboue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 3.1. Ephe. 2.19.</note> are called <hi>citisens with the saints,</hi> and <hi>fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low heires with Christ;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.17.</note> not that there are any perfect in this life, but because the <hi>Apostle</hi> in this chapter graunteth them <hi>a degree of perfection, who follow that they may comprehend, in as much as they are comprehended of Christ.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil, 3.12.</note> And therefore is the mysticall body of <hi>Christ,</hi> which hath an head in heauen, and members on earth, not vnfitly obserued, to make as it were that image, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.32, which had <hi>a head of fine gold, breast and arms of siluer, bellie and thighs of brasse, legs of yron, and feet of earth;</hi> for though the head be of finer then the finest gold, yet are the members purer or baser mettall, as they are neerer or farther off from their head. How much the more doth it appertaine to euery true member of this bodie, to
<pb facs="tcp:150375:116"/>stirre vp the grace that is giuen vnto vs, that by the assistance of his holy spirit, which in refining the mettals of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, is of farre more vertue then the philosophers stone, we may be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as it were from earth to iron, from iron to brasse, from brasse to siluer, and so to gold; that growing from faith to faith, from vertue to vertue, we may at length bee made liuely branches of the true vine, &amp; golden members of a goldē head. To summe vp all that hath bin hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto said, our faces are set vpward into heauē; we must mount like eagles aboue, not grouell in the earth like blind wants; our mind is of an heauenly substance, it hath another vse then the life of hogges, which as <hi>Varro</hi> thinketh was giuen vnto them but <hi>for salt to keepe their flesh from putrifying:</hi> the corruption that we drew from our father <hi>Adam,</hi> is taken away in Christ, who was borne a child vnto vs, that we might be new borne vnto him;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:150375:116"/>our new birth in <hi>Christ,</hi> though it haue a remnant of rebellion in the flesh, is yet assisted with the holy Ghost, that in the dulnesse of our nature, we may be lifted vp with the wings of grace: the loue that drew God down from heauen, requireth but a loue that may cary vs to heauen, &amp; we do but loue our selues in louing him: the world &amp; the glory therof are no such things, as that we need to be drawn with them, from that spiritual life, which hath more, &amp; more true nobility, beautie, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, riches, souerainty, wisdom, ioy, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and whatsoeuer the heart can wish for, then is to be found otherwise; it is a debt by the which we owe our selues, and more then our selues to him, who gaue himselfe for vs, not that we should liue after the flesh, but after the spirit; the tast that we haue in this life, by being of the houshold of faith, is inough to make vs to loath the things of the world, and not to content our selues, with thinking
<pb facs="tcp:150375:117"/>or talking or wishing of heauen but euen to striue to be perfect.</p>
            <p>All which though they may serue as fethers to the wings of our minds to make vs flie the world, and flie vnto God; forsake our selues, and <hi>haue our conuersation in heauen;</hi> yet that which doth chiefly put life into vs, is that which I obserued to bee the life of this conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, <hi>our hope,</hi> by the which <hi>we looke for our Sauiour, euen the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> For how can we but bee more then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the course of godlinesse, when we know <hi>we doe not runne as for an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie, nor fight as beating the aire,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.26. but we <hi>follow hard toward the marke for the price of the high calling of God in Christ Iesus,</hi> as we haue Philip. 3.14, when we know we are <hi>begotten to a liuely hope,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3; <hi>to an inheritance immortall and vndefiled, and that fadeth not away, reserued in heauen for vs.</hi> For albeit to liue godly in this life, bee no

<pb facs="tcp:150375:118"/>not of a momentarie but euerlasting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and of that valew, that it cannot be valued: shall the vaine hopes of this life, which are but the waking dreames of our idle conceits, carie vs farther with the shew of that which is not, then the liuely <hi>hope,</hi> which hath an assurance of <hi>a glorious inheritance?</hi> Eph. 1.18. But this is the foolishnesse of our iudgements, to be led with the deceitfull ballance of the outward appearance, to preferre the flesh pots of <hi>Aegypt</hi> before the promise of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan;</hi> and the land in which we lead a dying life, before the land of the liuing; whereas, if <hi>wee wait vpon the Lord, the strength</hi> of our hope <hi>shall bee renewed, we shall lift vp our wings as eagles, wee shall run and not be wearie, we shall walke and not faint.</hi> Esay 40.31.

               <hi>what is this birthright vnto me?</hi> to them is this day so terrible, as that they quake at the mention of it: and though they bee <hi>without God in this world,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephe. 2.12.</note>
               <hi>without hope</hi> in the world to come; yet can they not be without feare in this world, neither shall they bee without plagues in the world to come, <hi>their glory is shame, their end damnation, Phil.</hi> 3.19.</p>
            <p>Now that wee who liue by <hi>hope,</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:150375:119"/>might not be caried away with the sway of worldlings, to haue no other conceit of heauen, then is written to haue bene of <hi>Alcinous</hi> orchard, the pleasantnesse whereof, was so farre beyond other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards, that none would beleeue it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they saw it; therefore is this <hi>hope</hi> of ours grounded vpon <hi>faith,</hi> by the which wee are assured, that hee <hi>will change our vile bodies and make them like vnto his glorious bodie.</hi> A point of such necessitie to be beleeued, that <hi>if there be no resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead, then Christ is not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen; if Christ bee not risen, then is prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching vaine, &amp; faith also in vaine,</hi> 1. Cor. 15.13: for <hi>this is the will of God, not onely that euery one which seeth the sonne and beleeueth in him, should haue life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting;</hi> but also, that <hi>he will raise him vp in the last day, Iohn</hi> 6.40. And herein appeared the infinitenesse of his loue, who louing vs <hi>non solum in finem vitae, sed in finem etiam amoris,</hi> not onely to
<pb facs="tcp:150375:120"/>the end of that life, he led for vs; but to the end of loue it selfe, that is, as farre as wee were capable of his loue; thought it not inough to giue vnto our soules the riches of his spirit, vnlesse he indued our bodies also with the glory of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. For though the vnion betweene him and vs bee spirituall, yet doth hee call our <hi>bodies the members of Christ,</hi> 1. Cor. 6.15: not so onely, but also <hi>the temples of the holy Ghost,</hi> and euen in that respect they should not be subiect to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall corruption. For if other <hi>creatures which be subiect vnto vanitie doe wait</hi> (as it is in the eight to the Romanes) <hi>when the sonne of God shalbe reuealed,</hi> as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <hi>to be deliuered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious libertie of the sonnes of God;</hi> how much more are we to bee persuaded of our bodies? that since they are <hi>members of Christ</hi> they shall be restored vnto their <hi>head;</hi> that since in their corruption, they are vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:150375:120"/>to be the <hi>temples of the holy Ghost,</hi> they shall <hi>put on incorruption,</hi> that as they are graced in this life,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.53.</note> so they may bee glorified in the life to come? And this in some sort doth stand with the iustice of God, that since <hi>we beare about in our bodies the dying of our Lord Iesus: the life of Iesus should also bee made manifest in our bodies,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.10: not that the <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of this life are worthie of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie which shall be reuealed,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8.18.</note> but because he is a plenteous rewarder: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the soule of man had first a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life, but to liue in the bodie; so though for a time, it be separated from the bodie, that the corruption of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die may be done away, yet it is not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker in the spirituall life, of the full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of ioy, vntill it be restored againe vnto the bodie:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.53.</note> whose <hi>corruptible</hi> (as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaketh) <hi>must put on incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and mortall must put on immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talitie,</hi> because it cannot be made parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
<pb facs="tcp:150375:121"/>of the reward, which is eternall, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it selfe also become eternall. And therefore <hi>is it sowne in corruption, that it may be raised in incorruption; sowne in dishonour, that it may be raised in glorie; sowne in weakenesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.41. &amp;c.</note>
               <hi>that it may be raised in power; sowne a naturall bodie, that it may be raised a spirituall bodie:</hi> not that the bodie (as some haue thought) shall become a spirit, but that it shall be spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall both in knowledge and affection. The greatnesse of which glorie, though it be hard for flesh and blood to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue; yet to confirme our weakenesse, hath it pleased God in some measure to reueale it; and as, <hi>Numbers</hi> 13, hee gaue vnto some of his children a view of the land of promise, and a tast of the fruits, that the rest might bee encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to possesse it; so (in the 17. of <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi>) did he transfigure himselfe to some of his disciples, and in the beautie of his face,<note place="margin">Mat. 17.2.</note>
               <hi>which did shine as the Sunne,</hi> giue
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:150375:121"/>them a view of that glorie which his should haue with him. And if wee did but enter into the consideration of those things which are common amongst vs, we would thinke it not so vnlikely for <hi>our vile bodies to bee made glorious,</hi> as that fine paper should bee made of foule rags, or pure glasse of the ashes of ferne; especially when we find, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 37, that of a heape of naked and drie, and disjoynted, and dead bones, there were made faire and strong bodies, and life giuen vnto them with a blast of wind; when we heare <hi>Iob</hi> wish,<note place="margin">Iob. 19.23. &amp;c.</note>
               <hi>That his words were written in a booke, or grauen with an yron penne in lead or in stone for euer; how sure he is that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer liueth; and, that when wormes haue consumed his bodie, he shall see God in his flesh,</hi> yea, <hi>he himselfe shall see him, and his eyes behold him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what should we doubt of this point? when as Saint <hi>Austine</hi> noteth,
<pb facs="tcp:150375:122"/>
               <hi>in rebus mirabiliter factis, ratio facti est potentia facientis:</hi> the <hi>reason</hi> of this <hi>faith</hi> is his <hi>power,</hi> by the which <hi>hee hath sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued all things vnto himselfe.</hi> For to examine that which he hath promised, by that which he hath done, could he create all things of nothing, and can he not worke his owne will in his owne creatures? could he fetch light out of darkenesse, as it were out of a graue? can he in the wombe of a woman, of a little blood, frame a bodie distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with so many and sundrie instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as that it may goe for a little world, and within the space of some few dayes adde life vnto it? And can he not restore the bodie that hath been so, to that it was? Can he, as Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> argueth, doe so much for vs? and can he not doe as much with vs? Can he quicken vs in the wombe of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and can hee not reuiue vs in the wombe of our mother, the earth? Can
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:150375:122"/>he with the dew of the morning and euening giue life to the seed that is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the earth? And shall hee not with the sound of a trumpet and with all his power, giue life vnto vs? Can we of a little sparkle kindle great flames, and cannot he of our ashes, though they bee neuer so small, raise our bodies? Can we fetch fire out of the flint, and cannot hee fetch vs out of the earth, where wee were buried and kept as it were in his hand? Could <hi>Eliah</hi> and <hi>Elisha</hi> raise the <hi>widdow of Zareptha,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. King. 17.23 2. King. 4.32 Act. 9.40. Act. 20.10.</note> and the <hi>Shunanites children?</hi> Could <hi>Peter</hi> raise <hi>Tabitha,</hi> and <hi>Paule Eutychus?</hi> and cannot God, their Lord and ours, raise both them and vs? Hath not the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle</hi> set downe the forme of the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, how it shall bee done <hi>in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in the twinckling of an eye,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.52 1. Thes. 4.16.</note>
               <hi>how the Lord himself shall descend from heauen with a shout, and with the voice of the Archangell, and with the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
<pb facs="tcp:150375:123"/>of God?</hi> how the saints <hi>shall meet the Lord in the aire, and so shall euer be with the Lord?</hi> the power of Christ is so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest in this point, that if there were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> noteth, it were inough to proue him to bee a God. And if there bee no exception to be taken against his <hi>power,</hi> in that which hee hath so faithfully promised; how can we but beleeue the <hi>resurrection?</hi> and beleeuing the resurrection, <hi>hope for a Sauiour?</hi> and hoping for a Sauiour, <hi>haue our conuersation in heauen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And these are the principall points of this scripture; which hang as it were the links of a chaine, the one vpon the other, in so much as we cannot perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learne any one of them, except we learne them all; and we faile in all if we faile but in one of them. for how can we <hi>haue our conuersation in heauen,</hi> if we doe not looke for the comming of our Sauiour Christ? or how can wee
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:150375:123"/>
               <hi>looke for the comming of our Sauiour Christ,</hi> except wee beleeue the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection? or how can wee <hi>beleeue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,</hi> vnlesse wee acknowledge that <hi>power by the which hee is able to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all things vnto himselfe?</hi> againe how doe we acknowledge God to bee God, without the faith of the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? or how can wee haue the faith of the resurrection without the hope of a Sauiour? or how can we haue the hope of a Sauiour without an heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuersation? In all and euery of which, if we examine our selues, and the times in which wee liue; at which end so euer we begin, it will bee mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that neither in our <hi>conuersation,</hi> wee shew foorth the <hi>power</hi> of God; neither yet are so persuaded of the <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> of God, as that it doth reforme our <hi>conuersation.</hi> For if wee looke, I doe not say into the hidden corners of our consciences, but into those shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
<pb facs="tcp:150375:124"/>abuses, which are openly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and in the eye of the world; who can denie but that the loosenesse of our <hi>conuersation,</hi> prooueth vs to bee without <hi>hope,</hi> and our want of <hi>hope</hi> to bee without <hi>faith,</hi> and our want of <hi>faith</hi> to bee without <hi>God in this world?</hi> Againe, doe not many of our best wits, so tie the power of God vnto second causes, as that they grow doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, not onely of the <hi>resurrection of the bodie,</hi> but of <hi>the immortalitie of the soule?</hi> and thereby are not onely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>the hope of heauen,</hi> but euen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>the feare of hell;</hi> and thereby haue their <hi>conuersation</hi> not onely as though their minds were made of earth, but as though their soules were made of flesh? what then ramaineth, but that wee cast the reason of our faith vpon that <hi>power</hi> of Christ whereby <hi>hee hath subdued all things vnto himselfe, and in a full</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance, that hee will <hi>change our vile
